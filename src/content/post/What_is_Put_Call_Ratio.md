The ratio can provide insight into whether the market is leaning towards bearish or bullish sentiment.

Formula :- Volume of Put Options / Volume of Call Options

## There are two types of PCR :-

1. Volume-based PCR :- Measures the ratio based on trading volumes of puts and calls.

2. Open interest-based PCR :- Measures the ratio based on the open interest (the total number of outstanding option contracts).

## Interpreting PCR :-

1. PCR >1 :- More puts are being traded than calls, which could indicate a bearish sentiment. Investors are hedging or betting on a market decline.

2. PCR <1 :- More calls are being traded than puts, indicating a bullish sentiment. Investors expect the market or asset price to rise.

3. PCR =1 :- The market sentiment is considered neutral, with an equal number of puts and calls being traded.
