Options are derivative contracts that give buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price (called the strike price) before or on a certain date (known as the expiration date).

There are two types of options :-

## Call Option :-

Buyer's Perspective - A call option gives the buyer right but not the obligation to buy underlying asset at the strike price on or before the expiration date.
Seller's Perspective - The seller of the call option is obligated to sell the asset to the buyer if buyer exercises the option.

Example - If you buy a call option for a stock with a strike price of Rs. 50 and the stock rises to Rs.70, you can exercise your option to buy the stock at Rs. 50, allowing you to profit from the difference.

## Put Option :-

Buyer's Perspective - A put option gives the buyer right but not the obligation to sell underlying asset at the strike price on or before the expiration date.
Seller's Perspective - The seller of the put option is obligated to buy the asset from the buyer if buyer exercises the option.

Example - If you buy a put option with a strike price of Rs. 60 and the stock falls to Rs. 40, you can exercise your option to sell the stock at Rs.60, making a profit.
