We offer monthly and annual subscription plans. There are no refunds for monthly or annual plans. If you cancel a monthly/annual plan subscription, your subscription remains active for the remainder of your paid billing period.

Additionally, we offer a range of one-time cost products, such as live sessions, recorded educational content, which do not involve subscriptions but rather a one-time payment for access. These products are non-refundable once purchased and access is not indefinite and may have a limited duration. Make sure to check the specific terms and conditions associated with each product to understand the access period and any applicable limitations.

We are very proud of our platform and the team that supports you here at AmazeAlgos, and we believe you deserve to work with a company that is transparent and straightforward with all subscription billing and refunds.

If you have any questions about this policy before upgrading, please contact us at [AmazeAlgos@gmail.com](mailto:AmazeAlgos@gmail.com) and weâ€™d be happy to help answer any questions you have.
