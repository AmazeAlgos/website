## The Problem: Why Do Most Retail Traders Lose Money?

It’s a known fact that the majority of retail traders struggle in the options market. According to a report by SEBI, more than 93% of retail traders lose money in options trading. This staggering statistic highlights a key issue: many traders are not equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to succeed.
